Dharmasena seems to be the most sought after umpire for IPL matches followed by Ravi. Others are fairly close to each other.

It is interesting to see that the same names repeat again here as well. I think since these guys have played more number of balls, they have more dot balls as well.

Batsman with more than 300 balls faced in taken and the ones with higher percentage of dot balls are seen. It is interesting to see Ganguly with more than 1000 balls and nearly half of them are dot balls. It is surprising to see names like Jayasuriya and Gibbs in there.!

Caught is the most common dismissal type in IPL followed by Bowled. There are very few instances of hit wicket as well. 'Obstructing the field' is one of the dismissal type as well in IPL.!
