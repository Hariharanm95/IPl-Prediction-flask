Toss decision:

Let us see the toss decisions taken so far.

Almost 55% of the toss decisions are made to field first. Now let us see how this decision varied over time.
It seems during the initial years, teams wanted to bat first. Voila.! Look at the 2016 season, most of the toss decisions are to field first.
So percentage of times teams batting second has won is 53.2. Now let us split this by year and see the distribution.

Top players of the match:
CH Gayle is the top player of the match awardee in all the seasons of IPL.

Top Umpires:
Dharmasena seems to be the most sought after umpire for IPL matches followed by Ravi. Others are fairly close to each other.

Batsman analysis:
Let us start our analysis with batsman. Let us first see the ones with most number of IPL runs under their belt.

Virat Kohli is leading the chart followed closely by Raina. Gayle is the top scorer among foreign players.
Gambhir is way ahead of others - almost 60 boundaries more than Kohli.! Nice to Sachin in the top 10 list :)

It is interesting to see that the same names repeat again here as well. I think since these guys have played more number of balls, they have more dot balls as well.

Batsman with more than 300 balls faced in taken and the ones with higher percentage of dot balls are seen. It is interesting to see Ganguly with more than 1000 balls and nearly half of them are dot balls. It is surprising to see names like Jayasuriya and Gibbs in there.!

Harbhajan Singh is the the bowler with most number of balls bowled in IPL matches. Now let us see the bowler with more number of dot balls.
Pravin Kumar is the one with more number of dot balls followed by Steyn and Malinga
Malinga tops the chart with 221 extra runs followed by Pravin Kumar.

Caught is the most common dismissal type in IPL followed by Bowled. There are very few instances of hit wicket as well. 'Obstructing the field' is one of the dismissal type as well in IPL.!
